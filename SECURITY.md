# Security Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the Sparks & Marks website to protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure secure user interactions.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Form Security & Validation
- **React Hook Form with Zod validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation
- **Input sanitization**: Prevents XSS attacks through HTML encoding and dangerous content removal
- **Rate limiting**: 3 attempts per 5 minutes per email address to prevent abuse
- **Field length limits**: Prevents buffer overflow and DoS attacks
- **Email/phone validation**: Enhanced validation with security checks

### 2. Security Headers (Production)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS and injection attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Browser-level XSS protection
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts access to sensitive browser APIs

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **XSS Prevention**: Detects and blocks script injection attempts
- **Data sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before processing
- **Character encoding**: Dangerous characters are properly encoded
- **Content filtering**: Removes JavaScript and data URIs

### 4. Monitoring & Logging
- **Security event monitoring**: Tracks XSS attempts, rate limit violations, and suspicious activity
- **Client-side logging**: Development logging with production monitoring hooks
- **Error tracking**: Security-focused error handling and reporting

### 5. Production Configuration
- **Source map removal**: No source maps in production builds
- **Console log removal**: Debug information stripped from production
- **Code minification**: Reduces attack surface
- **Secure build options**: Optimized for security

## Security Event Types Monitored
- `form_submission`: Legitimate form submissions
- `rate_limit_exceeded`: Too many requests from single source
- `validation_error`: Failed validation attempts
- `xss_attempt`: Detected script injection attempts
- `suspicious_activity`: Other security-related events

## Rate Limiting Rules
- **Contact forms**: Maximum 3 submissions per 5 minutes per email
- **Client-side enforcement**: Immediate feedback to users
- **Memory-based tracking**: Resets on page refresh (server-side recommended for production)

## Validation Rules
- **Names**: 1-50 characters, no script tags
- **Email**: Valid format, length ≤ 254 characters, no dangerous content
- **Phone**: Valid international format, 8-15 digits
- **Project details**: 10-1000 characters, sanitized content
- **Company name**: Optional, ≤ 100 characters

## Security Best Practices Followed
1. **Defense in depth**: Multiple layers of security
2. **Input validation**: Never trust user input
3. **Output encoding**: Safe data display
4. **Security monitoring**: Track and respond to threats
5. **Secure configuration**: Production-hardened settings

## Future Security Enhancements
When integrating with a backend, consider:
- Server-side validation (never rely solely on client-side)
- Database query parameterization
- JWT token security
- API rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Session management
- File upload validation
- Server-side monitoring and alerting

## Security Testing Recommendations
- Regular penetration testing
- Automated security scanning
- XSS vulnerability testing
- CSRF protection verification
- Rate limiting effectiveness testing
- Security header validation

## Incident Response
Security events are logged and can be monitored. In production:
1. Set up real-time monitoring alerts
2. Configure log aggregation service
3. Establish incident response procedures
4. Regular security audit schedule
